# Creative Technology as a Personal Practice 

My area of focus is embodied presence, IoT, tied ot an exploration of consciousness in order to define a research question that is qualitative and qunatitavely viable. More specifically, I am interested in both analyzing and visualizing consciousresponse to stimuli.

I spent 6 days using the Muse EEG headband to better understand the namesake interface and biofeedback response designed for the system.

Following this exploration, I found that the audio response to brain activity proved to be overwhelming at times. 
As such, I began defining a research question on the possibility for haptic response to brain activity, and the possibility for expansion or altered states of consciousness through this tactile experience.
