# Creative Technology as a Personal Practice 

My area of focus is embodied presence, IoT, tied ot an exploration of consciousness in order to define a research question that is qualitative and qunatitavely viable. More specifically, I am interested in both analyzing and visualizing consciousresponse to stimuli.

I spent 6 days using the Muse EEG headband to better understand the namesake interface and biofeedback response designed for the system.

Following this exploration, I found that the audio response to brain activity proved to be overwhelming at times. 
As such, I began defining a research question on the possibility for haptic response to brain activity, and the possibility for expansion or altered states of consciousness through this tactile experience. I began by isolating the brain activity to study the response when my body was introduced to vibration through hand, or head during a meditation session. 
Meditation seemed to break when a handheld vibration was introduced.

This led me to focus on wearable haptic interaction addition to the Muse headband, which I then designed and prototyped, following extensive research on possible tech integrations.

Once I prototyped the Look & Feel, I realized I needed to further develop the role. Which led me to prototyping an app to pair with the CORE prototype for initial deployments.

Given more time, I would attempt to integrate or implement the various prototypes for a more cohesive user testing experience and further data collection for refinement of my research question.
