# Project 1 Week 1: API's of Interest

I am hoping to capture/analyze the current messaging of music and by proxy the cultural zeitgeist through the billboard hot 100 chart. Through using Billboard RapidKey API, Genius API (music lyrics & information), and Perspective API (NLP API which returns the probability if a text is toxic) I feel as though I can collect data from different time periods. I am going to start with analyzing the Billboard 100, top 10 songs and then hpe to expand to a custom query which I can sort through billboard data over the years and approximately understand how cultural messaging has evolved or disentegrated over time.

# Project 1 Week 2: Execution of API Chain 

The few weeks of attemting to find a useable API to capture the global music charts proved to be extremely difficult. After a weeks worth of attempts I chose a simpler API chain. Wherein I randomly generated a username, a joke, and a cat joke.
